# Working with loaded in csv files


Use the `read.csv()` function to read the data from the `gates_donations.csv` file (available on Canvas, make sure you save it in the project repository folder) into a variable called `grants` 

```{r}
## if you save it in the same folder as this file this should work. 
## But you may need edit the string to reflect the actual file name: 

grants <- read_csv("gates_donations.csv")


head(grants)
```

Because you're in an RProject, you don't need to set your working directory in RStudio! The working directory is automatically set to the repository location. (You can use `getwd()` to confirm this)

- Use the glimpse function to look at the loaded data

```{r}
glimpse(grants)
print(grants)
```


- Create a variable `org` that contains the `organization` column of the dataset

```{r}
org <- grants$organization
print(org)
```


- Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` function. (This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!)

```{r}
is_vector <- is.vector(org)
print(is_vector)
```


Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset:

- What was the mean grant value?

```{r}
mean_grant <- mean(grants$total_amount)
print(mean_grant)
```


- What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?

```{r}
largest_grant_value <- max(grants$total_amount)
print(largest_grant_value)
```


- What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?

```{r}
smallest_grant_value <- min(grants$total_amount)
print(smallest_grant_value)
```


- Which organization received the largest grant?

```{r}
org_largest_grant <- grants$organization[which.max(grants$total_amount)]
print(org_largest_grant)

```


- Which organization received the smallest grant?

```{r}
org_smallest_grant <- grants$organization[which.min(grants$total_amount)]
print(org_smallest_grant)
```

- How many grants were awarded in 2010?

```{r}
number_grants_2010 <- nrow(grants[grants$start_year == 2010, ])
print(number_grants_2010)
```

- How much was awarded in 2010? 

```{r}
grants_2010 <- grants[grants$start_year == 2010, ]
print(grants_2010)
value_grants_2010 <- sum(grants_2010$total_amount, na.rm = TRUE)
print(value_grants_2010)
```


# Working with built-in data sets

Load R's "USPersonalExpenditure" dataset using the `data()` function

This will produce a data frame called `USPersonalExpenditure`
```{r}
 data("USPersonalExpenditure")
print(USPersonalExpenditure)
```

The variable `USPersonalExpenditure` is now accessible to you. Unfortunately, it's not a data frame (it's actually a matrix, you can find that out using) 

Test this using the `is.data.frame()` function:

```{r}
is.data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)
print(USPersonalExpenditure)
```

Luckily, you can pass the USPersonalExpenditure variable as an argument to the `data.frame()` function to convert it a data frame.

Do this, storing the result in a new variable

```{r}
data_frame_US <- data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)
print(data_frame_US)
```


What are the current column names of your dataframe?
```{r}
col_name <- colnames(data_frame_US)
print(col_name)
```


Consider: why are they so strange? (Think about whether you could use a number like 1940 with dollar notation!)

What are the current row names of your dataframe?
```{r}
row_names <- rownames(data_frame_US)
print(row_names)
```


Add a column "Category" to your data frame that contains the rownames

```{r}
data_frame_US$Category <- rownames(data_frame_US)

```

Consider how this data isn't tidy. Use the `pivot_longer()` function from last class to make the data tidy. 

```{r}
tidy_data <- pivot_longer(data_frame_US, cols = -Category, names_to = "Year", values_to = "Expenditure")
print(tidy_data)
```


How much money was spent on personal care in 1940?
```{r}
personal_care_1940 <- tidy_data[tidy_data$Year== "X1940" & tidy_data$Category == "Personal Care", ]
print(personal_care_1940)
```


How much money was spent on Food and Tobacco in 1960?
```{r}
food_tabacco_1960 <- tidy_data[tidy_data$Year== "X1960" & tidy_data$Category == "Food and Tobacco", ]
print(food_tabacco_1960)

```


What was the highest expenditure category in 1960?
```{r}
expenditure_1960 <- tidy_data[tidy_data$Year== "X1960", ]
highest_expenditure_1960 <- expenditure_1960[which.max(expenditure_1960$Expenditure)]
print(highest_expenditure_1960)
```


Define a function `lowest_category` that takes in a year as a parameter, and returns the lowest spending category of that year
```{r}
lowest_category <- function(year) {
  year_col <- paste0("X", year)
  data_year <- tidy_data[tidy_data$Year == year_col, ]
  lowest_cat <- data_year[which.min(data_year$Expenditure), "Category"]
  return(lowest_cat)
}

```

```{r}

```


Using your function, determine the lowest spending category of each year
Hint: use the `sapply()` function to apply your function to a vector of years

```{r}
years <- c(1940, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960)
lowest_categories <- sapply(years, lowest_category)
print(lowest_categories)
```
